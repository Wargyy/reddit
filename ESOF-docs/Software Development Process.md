## Software Process Report


###About reddit
Reddit is an entertainment, social networking, and news website where registered community members can submit content, such as text posts or direct links, making it essentially an online bulletin board system. Registered users can then vote submissions up or down to organize the posts and determine their position on the site's pages. Content entries are organized by areas of interest called "subreddits". The subreddit topics include news, gaming, movies, music, books, fitness, food, and photosharing, among many others.

####Programming Language
Reddit was originally written in Common Lisp but was rewritten in Python some months later.

The reasons given for the switch were wider access to code libraries and greater development flexibility.

Three years later the project was made available as an open source project and is now hosted on GitHub.

####History

**June 2005**: Reddit was founded in Medford by two 22-year-old graduates of the University of Virginia. 

**November 2005 - January2006**: Reddit merged with Aaron Swartz's company Infogami, and Swartz became an equal owner of the resulting parent company, Not A Bug. 

**October 2006** Condé Nast Publications, owner of Wired, acquired Reddit and the team moved to San Francisco.

**January 2007** Swartz was fired.

By the end of 2008, the team had grown to include Erik Martin, Jeremy Edberg,[69] David King,[70] and Mike Schiraldi.[71] In 2009, Huffman and Ohanian moved on to form Hipmunk, recruiting Slowe[72] and King[73] shortly thereafter. In May 2010, Reddit was named in Lead411's "2010 Hottest San Francisco Companies" list.[74] In July 2010, after explosive traffic growth, Reddit introduced Reddit Gold, offering new features for a price of $3.99/month or $29.99/year.[75] Reddit Gold adds a number of features to the interface, including the ability to display more comments on a page, access to the private subreddit /r/lounge, and notifications whenever one's username is mentioned in a comment. It's also possible to endow comments or submissions of other users and thereby give a gold membership to them as an anonymous present.[76]

On September 6, 2011, Reddit became operationally independent of Condé Nast, now operating as a separate subsidiary of its parent company, Advance Publications.[77] On January 11, 2012, Reddit announced that it would be participating in a 12-hour sitewide blackout in protest of the Stop Online Piracy Act.[78] The blackout occurred on January 18 and coincided with the blackouts of Wikipedia and several other websites. In May 2012, Reddit joined the Internet Defense League, a group formed to organize future protests.[79] On February 14, 2013, Reddit began accepting the digital currency bitcoin for its Reddit Gold subscription service through a partnership with bitcoin payment processor Coinbase.[80]

In October 2014, Reddit announced Redditmade, a service which allowed moderators to create merchandise for their subreddits. Redditmade closed in February 2015.[81] In November 2014, Chief Executive Yishan Wong resigned and co-founder Ohanian returned as the full-time executive chairman. Ellen Pao, Reddit's business and partnerships strategist became the interim chief executive.[82] On July 10, 2015, Pao resigned and was replaced by Steve Huffman as CEO.[83][84]


###Structure
Não nos foi possivel encontrar informação relativamente ao processo de desenvolvimento de software do Reddit principalmente devido ao facto de a grande parte da criação do mesmo ter sido em closed source, tendo apenas sido disponibilizado em open source depois do seu "release".
