## Software Process Report


###About reddit
Reddit is an entertainment, social networking, and news website where registered community members can submit content, such as text posts or direct links, making it essentially an online bulletin board system. Registered users can then vote submissions up or down to organize the posts and determine their position on the site's pages. Content entries are organized by areas of interest called "subreddits". The subreddit topics include news, gaming, movies, music, books, fitness, food, and photosharing, among many others.

####Programming Language
Reddit was originally written in Common Lisp but was rewritten in Python some months later.
The reasons given for the switch were wider access to code libraries and greater development flexibility.
Three years later the project was made available as an open source project and is now hosted on GitHub.

####History

O código original do projeto foi desenvolvido em Lisp e mais tarde convertido para Python sendo disponibilizado em Open-Source.


###Estrutura
Não nos foi possivel encontrar informação relativamente ao processo de desenvolvimento de software do Reddit principalmente devido ao facto de a grande parte da criação do mesmo ter sido em closed source, tendo apenas sido disponibilizado em open source depois do seu "release".
