## Todo
```
1) Degree of Testability of the software program
Topics: Discuss how 'testable' is the program. Discuss how to improve the testability of software components.
 
The testability of software components (modules, classes) is determined by factors such as:
- Controllability: The degree to which it is possible to control the state of the component under test (CUT) as required for testing.
- Observability: The degree to which it is possible to observe (intermediate and final) test results.
- Isolateability: The degree to which the component under test (CUT) can be tested in isolation.
- Separation of concerns: The degree to which the component under test has a single, well defined responsibility.
- Understandability: The degree to which the component under test is documented or self-explaining.
- Heterogeneity: The degree to which the use of diverse technologies requires to use diverse test methods and tools in parallel.
 
2) Test Statistics
     Number of tests (# tests unit√°rios; # tests de sistema, # tests de desempenho, ...)
     % coverage (given by tools like EclEmma)
     Code coverage: is it any good? (see http://avandeursen.com/2013/11/19/test-coverage-not-for-managers/)
