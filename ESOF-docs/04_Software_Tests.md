## Degree of Testability of the Software
The Reddit software makes use of a collection of Unit tests that verify nearly all or most of the core functionalities of it, and can be found under the ``reddit/r2/r2/tests/`` directory of the repository.

#####Controllability [TODO]
The degree to which it is possible to control the state of the component under test (CUT) as required for testing.

#####Observability [TODO]
The degree to which it is possible to observe (intermediate and final) test results.

#####Isolateability [TODO]
The degree to which the component under test (CUT) can be tested in isolation.

#####Separation of concerns [TODO]
The degree to which the component under test has a single, well defined responsibility.

#####Understandability [TODO]
The degree to which the component under test is documented or self-explaining.

#####Heterogeneity [TODO]
The degree to which the use of diverse technologies requires to use diverse test methods and tools in parallel.

###Overall Degree of Testability [TODO]
Its something

## Test Statistics [TODO]
Number of tests (# tests unit√°rios; # tests de sistema, # tests de desempenho, ...)
% coverage (given by tools like EclEmma)
Code coverage: is it any good? (see http://avandeursen.com/2013/11/19/test-coverage-not-for-managers/)
